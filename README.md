<!-- Brief Description -->

## Overview

Leomund's Superhut is an application built to assist Dungeon Masters in the game of Dungeons and Dragons. During players in game shopping adventures, one would normally have to flip through the many pages of the player's handbook to search for items that are requested jot down the prices of these items and then do math at the end when the players finally decide on what they want. With Leomund's Superhut that is all streamlined allowing a Dungeon Master to easily calculate shopping totals and even add cost or provide discounts.

This is a project for Turing school to utilize our knowledge on a variety of front end tools and get to display our knowledge of React applications, testing and api interactions. It was originally built in the span of a long weekend.

## How to use

* On load the application will welcome the Dungeom Master(DM) and assist with some basic instructions. 
* At the storefront a DM can browse the categories of items and add the items they find interesting. Alternatively, they can use the search function to type in the name of a known item and add it to the cart. Each item has its title and cost displayed.
* A DM can then go to their cart and view their shopping list which can be eddited or cleared at this screen.
* A DM can also use the price modify slider to give a precentage discount or add an additional tax based on the players interactions with the storekeep.
